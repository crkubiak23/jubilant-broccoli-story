Once upon a time, there was a jubilant broccoli named antoine. He liked cheese, but that's a strange dynamic because they're both foods. Antoine liked to go camping, so he decided one day to take off for the woods.
Antonie is healthy to eat. Find him and kill him for your sake.

Except people are too bored to eat him. He is such a joke.
