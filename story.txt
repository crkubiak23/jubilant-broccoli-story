Once upon a time, there was a jubilant broccoli named antoine. He liked cheese, but that's a strange dynamic because they're both foods. Antoine liked to go camping, so he decided one day to take off for the woods.
Antonie is healthy to eat. Find him and kill him for your sake.

The best way to cook Antonie: In a large pot add water and salt, and then bring water to a boil over high heat. Add Antonie and cook until bright green in color and crispy tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer broccoli to a bowl filled with 4 cups water and 4 cups ice to stop the cooking process, about 5 minutes.
